# Changelog

One line per merged PR, newest first. Decisions live in `docs/adr/`.

- A backup is the household and nothing else: `hearth.db`, artifacts, resident memory
  and archived journal entries. The local inbox and noticeboard folders are no longer
  copied or verified, so a restored copy no longer carries their files.
- The `simulated` flag is gone from artifacts (schema 3), run context, snapshot, API
  responses, the backup manifest and the UI; the reconciliation source is now
  `operator_reported`, and an upgrade may drop a column only if the release lists it.
  Upgrading rewrites the run context, so a run admitted but never launched is asked to
  cancel and settles at zero. Backups pin the schema version: re-capture after upgrading,
  because a backup taken before this release can no longer be restored.
- The Codex subscription is the only runtime: mock runtimes, their stores and the
  runtime/process-boundary selectors are gone, tests drive a fake under `tests/`,
  and a store recorded against a removed runtime adopts the one runtime on start
  while its finished runs keep their own pin.
- Older Hearth stores upgrade forward on start with the original kept beside them;
  a quiet store may change runtime kind; docs rule trimmed to ADR + changelog (ADR 0013).
